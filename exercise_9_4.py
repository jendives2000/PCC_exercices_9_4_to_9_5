# Exercises 9-4 & 9-5 from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
# These exercises are about Classes and introduces Object Oriented Programming concepts.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 9-4:
# 1a. Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162).
# 1a.1. Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0.
# 1a.2. Create an instance called restaurant from this class.
# 1a.3. Print the number of customers the restaurant has served,
# 1a.4. and then change this value and print it again.
# 2a. Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that have been served.
# 2a.1. Call this method with a new number
# 2a.2.  and print the value again.
# 3a. Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served.
# 3a.1 Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.
